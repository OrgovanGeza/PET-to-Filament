# PET to Filament
This project is to document my journey of creating a machine that transforms PET bottles into 3D printer Filament.  
I'm combining 2 existing projects into one, using the best ideas from both worlds:
- [Petalot](https://github.com/function3d/petalot "Petalot project's Github page") by [Function3D](https://linktr.ee/function.3d) 
- [Petamentor2](https://petamentor2.com/ "Petamentor2 project's website") by [Ondřej Šraitr](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594548605536945) 

**The extruder is built from the following parts:**
- PET bottle cutter (based on Petalot)
- Cutter height adjuster (based on Petamentor2)
- PET string guider and cleaner (based on Petalot)
- Nozzle that turns PET string into filament
- Heatblock & heater to heat the nozzle
- Thermocontoroller that controlls the heater (based on Petamentor2)
- Motor, and a spool that pulls the PET through the cutter & nozzle, and collects the filament on the spool (based on Petamentor2)
- Motor Speed Controller (based on Petamentor2)

I collected all the STLs, pictures, diagrammes, material lists from both projects, and put them into their respective folders.  
The STLs, pictures and other files that I actually used to build my version are in the main folder.
