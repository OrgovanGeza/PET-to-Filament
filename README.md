# PET to Filament
This project is to document my journey of creating a machine that transforms PET bottles into 3D printer Filament.  
I'm combining existing projects into one, using the best ideas from all worlds:
- Base of the whole project: [Petamentor2](https://petamentor2.com/ "Petamentor2 project's website") by [Ondřej Šraitr](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594548605536945)
- [Bearing Cutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc2vt349XlI&ab_channel=MatthieuSAMSON) by [Mak3D](https://www.youtube.com/@-Mak3D) 
- [Petalot](https://github.com/function3d/petalot "Petalot project's Github page") by [Function3D](https://linktr.ee/function.3d) 


**The extruder is built from the following parts:**
- PET bottle cutter
- PET string guider and cleaner
- Nozzle that turns PET string into filament
- Heatblock & heater to heat the nozzle
- Thermocontoroller that controls the heater
- Motor, and a spool that pulls the PET through the cutter & nozzle, and collects the filament on the spool
- Motor Speed Controller

The STLs, gcodes, pictures and other files that I actually used to build my version are in the main folder in their respective folders.
I collected all the STLs, pictures, diagrams, material lists from the "base" projects, and put them into their respective folders as well.  

## The beginnings
I purchased every needed electronic / hardware part, and collected + sliced all the STLs. 
When the packages arrived I re-measured every dimension, and printed the plastic parts.

Some tools that is 100% necessary for the assembpy process:
- drill,
- 2mm - 8mm drill heads,
- screwdriver with bitheads,

## Platform with switchholders and adapter
I started the assembly with adding the 4 legs to the corners, and the holders for the controllers and the switches.
After that, I mounted the adapter, and wired it with the main switch.
