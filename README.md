# PET to Filament
This project is to document my journey of creating a machine that transforms PET bottles into 3D printer Filament.  
I'm combining 2 existing projects into one, using the best ideas from both worlds:
- [petalot](https://github.com/function3d/petalot "petalot project's Github page") by [Function3D](https://www.youtube.com/c/Function3d) 
- [Petamentor2](https://petamentor2.com/ "Petamentor2 project's website") by [Ondřej Šraitr](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594548605536945)
