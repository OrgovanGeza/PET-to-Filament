# PET to Filament
This project is to document my journey of creating a machine that transforms PET bottles into 3D printer Filament.  
I'm combining existing projects into one, using the best ideas from all worlds:
- Base of the whole project: [Petamentor2](https://petamentor2.com/ "Petamentor2 project's website") by [Ondřej Šraitr](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594548605536945)
- [Bearing Cutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc2vt349XlI&ab_channel=MatthieuSAMSON) by [Mak3D](https://www.youtube.com/@-Mak3D) 
- [Petalot](https://github.com/function3d/petalot "Petalot project's Github page") by [Function3D](https://linktr.ee/function.3d) 


**The extruder is built from the following parts:**
- PET bottle cutter
- PET string guider and cleaner
- Nozzle that turns PET string into filament
- Heatblock & heater to heat the nozzle
- Thermocontoroller that controls the heater
- Motor, and a spool that pulls the PET through the cutter & nozzle, and collects the filament on the spool
- Motor Speed Controller

I collected all the STLs, pictures, diagrams, material lists from the projects, and put them into their respective folders.  
The STLs, gcodes, pictures and other files that I actually used to build my version are in the main folder also in their respective folders.
